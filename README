# f

f is a system fetch program which lists only the system information that
matters:

- username@hostname
- OS and version
- architecture
- shell
- editor
- 16 colors

# usage

f is written in C, so you'll need a C compiler. Optionally, a Makefile is
included for use with GNU Make. After you build and install f, you can simply
run f. There are no options.
